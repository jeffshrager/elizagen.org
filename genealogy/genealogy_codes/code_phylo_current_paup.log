Heuristic search settings:
  Optimality criterion = parsimony
    Character-status summary:
      Of 10 total characters:
        All characters are of type 'unord'
        All characters have equal weight
        2 characters are constant (proportion = 0.2)
        1 variable character is parsimony-uninformative
        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 7
    Gaps are treated as "missing"
  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
    Addition sequence: random
    Number of replicates = 200
    Starting seed = generated automatically
    Number of trees held at each step = 1
  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
    Steepest descent option not in effect
  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  No topological constraints in effect
  Trees are unrooted

Error(#143): Keyword "savetrees" is not recognized.
                 If the keyword is valid for the current command and it is spelled correctly, look for problems in a previous command,
                 such as a missing semicolon.
