Heuristic search settings:
  Optimality criterion = parsimony
    Character-status summary:
      Of 13 total characters:
        All characters are of type 'unord'
        All characters have equal weight
        2 characters are constant (proportion = 0.153846)
        2 variable characters are parsimony-uninformative
        Number of parsimony-informative characters = 9
    Gaps are treated as "missing"
  Starting tree(s) obtained via stepwise addition
    Addition sequence: random
    Number of replicates = 100
    Starting seed = generated automatically
    Number of trees held at each step = 20
  Branch-swapping algorithm: tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) with reconnection limit = 8
    Steepest descent option not in effect
  Initial 'Maxtrees' setting = 100 (will be auto-increased by 100)
  Branches collapsed (creating polytomies) if maximum branch length is zero
  'MulTrees' option in effect
  No topological constraints in effect
  Trees are unrooted

                 If the keyword is valid for the current command and it is spelled correctly, look for problems in a previous command,
                 such as a missing semicolon.
