- feature_name: initial_greeting_and_name_handling
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program begins with a greeting sequence that asks
    for and then uses the user's name in subsequent dialogue.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: keyword_based_response_routing
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program routes to different response branches
    primarily by checking for specific keywords or phrases in the user input.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: prefix_matching_on_input
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program uses fixed-length prefix extraction (e.g.,
    first N characters of the input) to detect patterns rather than full-string or
    arbitrary substring matching.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: tokenization_by_whitespace_scan
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program manually scans the input string character
    by character to locate spaces and extract individual word tokens.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: pronoun_and_possessive_referencing
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program detects pronouns or possessive words (e.g.,
    "YOU", "YOUR", "MY") and uses them to construct context-sensitive follow-up questions.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: topic_specific_subdialogues
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program has distinct sub-dialogue branches dedicated
    to particular topics or emotional states (e.g., depression, anger, computers).
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: yes_no_branching_logic
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program explicitly checks for yes/no style responses
    and branches to different dialogue paths based on them.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: iterative_conversation_loop
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program repeatedly returns to a central input
    point to continue the conversation after handling each user response.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: minimal_state_persistence
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program avoids maintaining long-term conversational
    state beyond the current input and a few transient variables, with no explicit
    session memory or history.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: hardcoded_string_comparisons
  type: binary
  definition: Indicates whether the program relies on direct comparisons to hardcoded
    literal strings for all pattern recognition, without using tables, maps, or external
    pattern definitions.
  value_for_this_program: true
- feature_name: keyword_table_driven_routing
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program stores its keyword patterns in data tables
    or arrays and iterates over them to find matches, instead of using only inline
    literal comparisons.
- feature_name: rotating_reply_index_per_keyword
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program maintains per-keyword indices to cycle
    through multiple possible replies for that keyword across turns.
- feature_name: repeated_input_detection
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program compares the current user input with the
    previous input to detect and respond specially to repeated utterances.
- feature_name: keyword_priority_selection
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program assigns numeric priorities to keywords
    or keyphrases and selects the response based on the highest-priority match found
    in the input.
- feature_name: dictionary_based_conjugation
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program uses a per-word dictionary or property
    list to map tokens to their conjugated forms when transforming user input.
- feature_name: pattern_based_sentence_matching_with_regex
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program converts abstract pattern templates into
    regular expressions and uses them to match entire user sentences.
- feature_name: binding_list_variable_substitution
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program binds matched substrings to named variables
    and later substitutes those variables into response templates.
- feature_name: cyclic_default_response_sequence
  type: binary
  states: null
  definition: Indicates whether the program cycles through a fixed list of default
    responses in order, ensuring each is used once before any are repeated.
