  "Animal Farm written by George Orwell is an animal fable that happens in a farm where animals start building a communism society, but end up becoming totalitarianism, hinting obliquely at the communists in the real world.",
  "The gaps between the pigs and other common animals demonstrate the theme that the corruption of power appears when the majority is ruled.",
  "The intelligence superiority allows the pigs to place themselves at a position which is closer to power and more easily corruptible.",
  "The inability to question the authority makes the other common animals become the naïve working class, who suffer the corrupting influence of power.",
  "The nature of the pigs, greed, is the source of their undying lust for ultimate power.",
  "Instead of questioning the unfair treatment, the animals think less and do more work.",
  "Common animals are a naive working class, who are unable or unwilling to question authority, condemning themselves to suffer the full extent of the ruling class’s oppression.",
  "After having a taste of power, the pigs lose themselves in their lust for ultimate power.",
  "Because of the supreme position of the pigs in the farm, a minority controls the majority of the animals, and their greed for power leads to the corruption of power.",
  "Napoleon uses dogs to expel Snowball in order to have exclusive power.",
  "Napoleon opposes every suggestion Snowball proposes at the beginning.",
  "Napoleon raises the puppies secretly and reveals them while excluding Snowball.",
  "The fierce dogs become a sign of Napoleon’s authority and absolute power.",
  "It is the first time that execution happens on the farm, which disobeys the essence of Animalism, where all animals are friends.",
  "However, none of the animals dare to question Napoleon because Napoleon has absolute power, even though Napoleon’s power is corrupting.",
  "When the pigs move into the farmhouse and begin sleeping in beds, the Fourth Commandment mysteriously changes.",
  "The new Fourth Commandment reads, 'No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets.'",
  "The bed is a symbol of being human in the story.",
  "The pigs' greed for being human has not gone unnoticed.",
  "As symbolism in Animal Farm, there is a lot to interpret in the story.",
  "The symbolism is more of an allegory because it conveys a political moral.",
  "According to George Orwell, Animal Farm is a fable, which is a short story played by animals conveying a moral to the reader.",
  "Although the main context of the story is about the USSR and the rise and fall of Communism, to George Orwell, it can represent both communist and capitalist government.",
  "One common symbol throughout the story is when the pigs address their fellow animals using the term 'comrades,' which has a double meaning.",
  "One meaning of 'comrades' refers to a companion or friend, and the other refers to addressing a fellow communist.",
  "This usage of 'comrades' is brilliant in my opinion.",
  "The Rebellion symbolizes the Russian Revolution in the 1900s, but it can represent other revolutions common to many countries rebelling against the harsh rule of a powerful government.",
  "Moses, the crow, stands out as a character who is barely mentioned in most of the book but reappears at the beginning and end, talking about Sugarcandy Mountain, a place with no sorrows, like a utopia or paradise.",
  "Most of the pigs despise Moses and encourage the other animals to ignore his proclamations.",
  "Moses represents religion, specifically the Russian Orthodox Church.",
  "In the Soviet Union, belief in religion was forbidden because it disobeyed Karl Marx’s ideas.",
  "Religious figures like bishops and priests were executed in the Soviet Union.",
  "The Catholic laity also met the same fate, whether by firing squad, being sent to labor camps, or psychiatric hospitals for 'treatment,' most never to be seen again.",
  "In Animal Farm, Old Major preached that under Animalism, everybody’s sorrows would disappear and equality would reign, creating a utopia.",
  "As the story progresses, the world under Animalism becomes no different than Jones's rule.",
  "At the end of the story, the pigs literally become human, walking on their hind feet, drinking, gambling, and cheering with the other animals, just like humans.",
  "Napoleon took no interest in Snowball’s committees and said that the education of the young was more important than anything.",
  "Orwell uses this to show how Napoleon works, where Napoleon wishes to educate the young as they are more impressionable and easier to manipulate.",
  "Squealer then goes as far as to state, 'And as to the Battle of the Cowshed, I believe the time will come when we shall find that Snowball's part in it was much exaggerated.'",
  "Orwell uses this dialogue to foreshadow the irony of how Napoleon’s role in the Battle of the Cowshed will be exaggerated, while degrading Snowball’s role.",
  "The novel, Animal Farm by George Orwell, is an illustration of an allegory because the author uses literary or rhetorical devices to convey a hidden message.",
  "Orwell utilizes symbolic figures, actions, and events to create a political message.",
  "Orwell was successful in utilizing an allegory to convey his message about Communism and the Russian Revolution.",
  "Orwell’s allegory emphasizes the actions, mentalities, and qualities of the noteworthy figures he was depicting without specifically naming any historical figures.",
  "Orwell allows readers to reach their own conclusions and discover the lessons presented within the novel.",
  "Orwell’s allegory is successful in presenting the absurdity of Communism, and it is fairly effective throughout the novel.",
  "The plot is a purposeful anecdote where the animals symbolize historical figures from the Russian Revolution who overthrow Mr. Jones, the owner of Manor Farm.",
  "At first, the rebellion's purpose was to make all animals equal, but soon differences begin to rise between the different species and classes.",
  "Orwell depicts how a society’s belief system can be changed and controlled by those who have immense power.",
  "In the novel, the pigs represent the Soviet Union, while the other animals represent the working class.",
  "The pigs accumulate an immense amount of power, which allows them to rule over the working class.",
  "In Chapter Two, Snowball declared that 'Ribbons should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. All animals should go naked.'",
  "In Chapter Ten, Napoleon and the other pigs contradict this concept by wearing clothes from Mr. Jones's wardrobe.",
  "The pigs were walking around on their hind legs and engaging in business with humans.",
  "Napoleon never realized that his mentality was equivalent to Mr. Jones’s, and that he was no better at controlling the farm.",
  "The story of Animal Farm was used to discuss the Russian revolution and to show how pointless much of what happened afterward was.",
  "In Animal Farm, the pigs convince the animals to rise up and overtake Mr. Jones and humankind in general.",
  "However, after they take over the farm, the pigs accumulate more power and begin to get rid of their enemies.",
  "This is similar to how the leaders of Russia took over and then abused the people, taking most of the wealth for themselves.",
  "Animal Farm shows how absurd communism was in countries like Russia, where the leaders pretend to be doing everything for the people but were really doing it for their own benefit.",
  "Another quote shows the comparison to the Russian revolution with the use of the word 'comrades,' which is a term frequently used in the Russian Revolution.",
  "Themes shown in Animal Farm are leadership and corruption, lies and deceit, rules and order, violence, and cunning and cleverness.",
  "George Orwell’s Animal Farm shows a lot of leadership, power, and how power can be easily corrupted.",
  "The most evident event of this theme being portrayed is when Napoleon uses fear and propaganda to rule over the farm.",
  "Evidence of Napoleon using fear can be seen when Snowball and Napoleon fought over whether the windmill should be built.",
  "Napoleon will blame most of the farm’s problems on Snowball, even when Snowball is no longer present.",
  "Napoleon sends Boxer to the glue factory, despite the animals being told by Squealer that Boxer died in the hospital.",
  "Napoleon does not shy away from sentencing his fellow animals to death.",
  "A violent fight breaks out at the end of the novel when Napoleon and Mr. Pilkington throw down aces in a card game.",
  "On the surface, George Orwell’s novel Animal Farm is about a group of neglected farm animals who overthrow their owner and take control of the farm.",
  "However, under the surface, this novel is an allegory detailing the events of the Russian Revolution.",
  "Orwell wrote Animal Farm as a warning to readers with the central theme that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely."
