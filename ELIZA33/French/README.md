This is a simulation of ELIZA running on an ASR33 Teletype, created by
Jeff Shrager, Antony Hay, and Leo Armel. Its purpose is to give you a
sense of what it was like to use the original ELIZA.

The ELIZA here is Anthony Hay's, which is the closest known simulation
of Joseph Weizenbaum's original MAD-SLIP ELIZA from the mid 1960. The
original ELIZA would definitely have run on various teletype-like
devices, and most likely on ASR33s (although Weizenbaum appears to
have had an IBM 2741 at home).

Jeff Shrager wrote the TTY simulation (with a bit of help from
ChatGPT). The photograph is by Anthony Hay. Leo Armel suggested a
method for getting the output to scroll correctly.

To run this just pull down the files into whatever folder you like,
and then drag ELIZA33.html into your favorite browser. It's known to
work well on Chrome, and the audio timing seems a bit off on Safari.
We haven't carefully tested on other browsers, but folks have reported
that it works there as well.
