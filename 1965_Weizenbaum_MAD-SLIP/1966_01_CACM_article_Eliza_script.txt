; APPENDIX. An Eliza Script
;
; Transcribed from Joseph Weizenbaum's article on page 36 of the January
; 1966 edition of Communications of the ACM titled 'ELIZA - A Computer
; Program For the Study of Natural Language Communication Between Man And
; Machine'.
;
; "Keywords and their associated transformation rules constitute the
; SCRIPT for a particular class of conversation. An important property of
; ELIZA is that a script is data; i.e., it is not part of the program
; itself." -- From the above mentioned article.
;
; Transcribed by Anthony Hay, December 2020
;
;
; Notes
;
; This is a verbatim transcription of the ELIZA script in the above
; mentioned CACM article, with the following caveats:
; a) Whitespace has been added to help reveal the structure of the
;    script.
; b) In the appendix six lines were printed twice adjacent to each other
;    (with exactly 34 lines between each duplicate), making the structure
;    nonsensical. These duplicates have been commented out of this
;    transcription.
; c) One closing bracket has been added and noted in a comment.
; d) There were no comments in the script in the CACM article.
;
;
; The script has the form of a series of S-expressions of varying
; composition. (Weizenbaum says "An ELIZA script consists mainly of a set
; of list structures...", but nowhere in the article are S-expressions or
; LISP mentioned. Perhaps it was too obvious to be noted.) Weizenbaum says
; ELIZA was written in MAD-Slip. It seems his original source code has
; been lost. Weizenbaum developed a library of FORTRAN functions for
; manipulating doubly-linked lists, which he called Slip (for Symmetric
; list processor).
;
; The most common transformation rule has the form:
;
;   (keyword [= replacement-keyword] [precedence]
;     [ ((decomposition-rule-0) (reassembly-rule-00) (reassembly-rule-01) ...)
;       ((decomposition-rule-1) (reassembly-rule-10) (reassembly-rule-11) ...)
;       ... ] )
;
; where [] denotes optional parts. Initially, ELIZA tries to match the
; decomposition rules against the input text only for the highest ranked
; keyword found in the input text. If a decomposition rule matches the
; input text the first associated reassembly rule is used to generate
; the output text. If there is more than one reassembly rule they are
; used in turn on successive matches.
;
; In the decomposition rules '0' matches zero or more words in the input.
; So (0 IF 0) matches "IF POSSIBLE" and "WHAT IF YOU DIE". Numbers in
; the reassembly rules refer to the parts of the decomposition rule
; match. 1 <empty>, 2 "IF", 3 "POSSIBLE" and 1 "WHAT", 2 "IF", 3 "YOU DIE"
; in the above examples. If the selected reassembly rule was (DO YOU THINK
; ITS LIKELY THAT 3) the text output would be "DO YOU THINK ITS LIKELY
; THAT YOU DIE".
;
;
; Each rule has one of the following six forms:
;
; R1. Plain vanilla transformation rule. [page 38 (a)]
;     (keyword [= keyword_substitution] [precedence]
;         [ ((decomposition_pattern) (reassembly_rule) (reassembly_rule) ... )
;            (decomposition_pattern) (reassembly_rule) (reassembly_rule) ... )
;            :
;            (decomposition_pattern) (reassembly_rule) (reassembly_rule) ... )) ] )
;   e.g.
;     (MY = YOUR 2
;         ((0 YOUR 0 (/FAMILY) 0)
;             (TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY)
;             (WHO ELSE IN YOUR FAMILY 5)
;             (=WHAT)
;             (WHAT ELSE COMES TO MIND WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR 4))
;         ((0 YOUR 0 (*SAD UNHAPPY DEPRESSED SICK ) 0)
;             (CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT MADE YOU 5))
;         ((0)
;             (NEWKEY)))
;
;
; R2. Simple word substitution with no further transformation rules. [page 39 (a)]
;     (keyword = keyword_substitution)
;   e.g.
;     (DONT = DON'T)
;     (ME = YOU)
;
;
; R3. Allow words to be given tags, with optional word substitution. [page 41 (j)]
;     (keyword [= keyword_substitution]
;         DLIST (/ <word> ... <word>))
;   e.g.
;         (FEEL               DLIST(/BELIEF))
;         (MOTHER             DLIST(/NOUN FAMILY))
;         (MOM = MOTHER       DLIST(/ FAMILY))
;
;
; R4. Link to another keyword transformation rule. [page 40 (c)]
;     (keyword [= keyword_substitution] [precedence]
;         (= equivalence_class))
;   e.g.
;         (HOW                (=WHAT))
;         (WERE = WAS         (=WAS))
;         (DREAMED = DREAMT 4 (=DREAMT))
;         (ALIKE 10           (=DIT))
;
;
; R5. As for R4 but allow pre-transformation before link. [page 40 (f)]
;     (keyword [= keyword_substitution]
;         ((decomposition_pattern)
;             (PRE (reassembly_rule) (=equivalence_class))))
;   e.g.
;     (YOU'RE = I'M
;         ((0 I'M 0)
;             (PRE (I ARE 3) (=YOU))))
;
;
; R6. Rule to 'pre-record' responses for later use. [page 41 (f)]
;     (MEMORY keyword
;         (decomposition_pattern_1 = reassembly_rule_1)
;         (decomposition_pattern_2 = reassembly_rule_2)
;         (decomposition_pattern_3 = reassembly_rule_3)
;         (decomposition_pattern_4 = reassembly_rule_4))
;   e.g.
;     (MEMORY MY
;         (0 YOUR 0 = LETS DISCUSS FURTHER WHY YOUR 3)
;         (0 YOUR 0 = EARLIER YOU SAID YOUR 3)
;         (0 YOUR 0 = BUT YOUR 3)
;         (0 YOUR 0 = DOES THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT YOUR 3))
;
;
; In addition, there must be a NONE rule with the same form as R1. [page 41 (d)]
;     (NONE
;         ((0)
;             (reassembly_rule)
;             (reassembly_rule)
